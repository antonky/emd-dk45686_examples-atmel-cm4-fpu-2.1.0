 * @param msb_1: second timer value obtained during the first read
 * @param hsb_1: third timer value obtained during the first read
 * @param lsb_2: first timer value obtained during the second read
 * @param msb_2: second timer value obtained during the second read
 * @param hsb_2: third timer value obtained during the second read
 * @return Concatenated LSB and MSB and HSB
 * @details
 * This function supposes that the three timers that are fed as input are
 * chained, meaning that the second timer counts the overflows of the first
 * timer, and the third timer counts the overflow of the second timer. It also
 * supposes that the three reads of the three timers are done as close as
 * possible in time. It needs three timer reads in order to detect if there was
 * an overflow between the read of the first timer and the read of the second
 * timer and third timer.
 * @note:
 * The two timers have to be read lsb then msb then hsb. Reading them in another
 * order might prevent this function from detecting an overflow that took place
 * between three timer reads.
